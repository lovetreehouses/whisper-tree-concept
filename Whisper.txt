TREEHOUSE LIFE “WISH-LIST WHISPERER”
Product Brief

Overview
The Wish-List Whisperer is a premium conversational web app designed for Treehouse Life Ltd. It guides High-Net-Worth (HNW) and Ultra-High-Net-Worth (UHNW) clients from an initial “wish-list” of ideas — captured via text or voice — to a personalised, founder-voiced project concept. The app then facilitates booking consultations, arranging WhatsApp video calls, and delivering a bespoke online project brochure, creating a seamless journey from inspiration to engagement.

Target User
HNW and UHNW clients with gardens, estates, or woodland properties.
Individuals and families who value craftsmanship, privacy, and emotional connection.
Time-poor but inspired, seeking effortless, beautiful digital experiences that feel personally guided by Paul Cameron, Founder of Treehouse Life Ltd.

Problem
Clients know how they want to feel, not what to build. They struggle to visualise ideas and often lose momentum before engaging professionally. Treehouse Life requires a scalable yet personal solution to:
Capture early-stage inspiration.
Preserve the founder’s voice and brand authenticity.
Convert client dreams into actionable consultation opportunities efficiently.

Solution
A WhatsApp-style conversational web app that:
Captures client wish-lists via text or voice.
Uses GPT-5 trained on Paul Cameron’s Notion library to generate bespoke project concepts.
Mirrors client language to foster emotional ownership and trust.
Guides clients to:
Book a consultation via Motion live calendar.
Receive a personalised online brochure via Qwilr.
Connect via WhatsApp Business video. All interactions maintain founder-led tone, warmth, and luxury simplicity.
